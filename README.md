# FAST (Python API)
A Python toolbox for FAST

In this package, you can find several submodules for preprocessing, running and
post-processing [FAST simulation tool](https://github.com/insa-rouen/fast).
- **pywind** FAST IECWind and TurbSim module
- **pywt** FAST WindTurbine configuration module
- **pyfast** FAST module with several pre-configurations for IEC 61400-1 DLCs
- **pylife** Fatigue and other mechanics anlaysis module
- **pycrunch** Post-processing module for calculation
- **pygraph** Post-processing module for plotting
- **pyopti** Optimisation module
- **tools** Some useful tools like read FAST output file (.out), measure elapsed
    time during execution, send email when calculation is finished on server ...

All modules have been developed and tested under macOS 10.15.7 and Ubuntu 
20.04.02 LTS.
